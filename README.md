### **Python Web Scraper - Internship Assessment**

This repository contains a Python script that scrapes job listings from a public data source and stores them in a PostgreSQL database. It serves as a practical assessment to evaluate skills in web scraping, data handling, and automation.

### **Project Approach & The Challenges I Faced**

I initially began this project with the goal of scraping "Data Analyst" job postings from Indeed. My first approach used the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries, but I quickly ran into a significant hurdle: the website responded with a **403 Forbidden** error, a clear sign that my automated script was being blocked.

To overcome this, I pivoted to a more advanced method using **Selenium**, a browser automation tool. I also implemented several stealth techniques to make the script appear more like a human user. However, this, too, was unsuccessful. The website's anti-bot measures were so sophisticated that they detected my automated browser and terminated the session, leading to a persistent `InvalidSessionIdException`.

Recognizing that fighting these advanced security systems was a separate and complex project in itself, I decided on a new approach to fulfill the assignment's core requirements. I chose to demonstrate my skills on a public data source—**Hacker News**—which is known for its static pages and lack of anti-bot measures. This allowed me to successfully build a **robust and reliable** solution that showcases my ability to:

  * **Connect to and manage a PostgreSQL database** using `psycopg2`.
  * **Scrape data from a live website** using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
  * **Handle data insertion** into a structured database table.

This final script proves that I can adapt my strategy to deliver a working solution, even when faced with real-world technical challenges.

### **How to Run the Script**

1.  **Database Setup:**

      * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your local machine.
      * Create a new database named `internship_assessment`.
      * Update the `.env` file with your database credentials.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

      * Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
      * Create and activate a virtual environment.
      * Install all necessary libraries using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3.  **Run the Script:**

      * Execute the Python script from your terminal:
        ```bash
        python Assessment.py
        ```

    The script will automatically scrape the latest jobs and store them in your database.
